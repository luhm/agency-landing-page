# Frontend Mentor - Agency Landing Page

![Design preview for agency landing page challenge on Frontend Mentor](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Hi! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Luiza Moretti and I am starting on the world of Front-end!

Thanks for checking out this coding challenge. I've got it from Frontend Mentor website, so you should check it out too.

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

## The challenge

The challenge is to build out a given agency landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.
The design can be seen on the top of this page :P

## Where to find everything

All design and assets used are inside the `/design` and the `/image` folder, both mobile and desktop versions.

- The `style-guide.md` file contains the information needed to complete the project, such as color palette and fonts.

## My timeline

<ins>**04/12/2024**

Today I started the challenge, create the repository and organized the files. I also made a pre-project by hand where I decide what to do with every part of the project. I answer questions such as:

- Are there any colors/fonts/design that repeat itself through out the page?
- Are there any element that change color/side when comparing mobile and desktop versions?
    - If yes, which ones?
    - How I pretend to organize the css file to make those changes smoothly and without repeating my code time and time again?

Those answers help me find better ways to think my code and my project, and to organize my work on what should I do now and when do the other things.

<ins>**06 and 07/12/2024**

Since I haven't been able to dedicate much time to this project the las few days, I decided to use much of my free time these two days to work on it.
I am working with mobile-first methodology. The mobile design seems very easily divided, with different "blocks" of content. I didn't had much difficulty with the `p` and `h1` styles, but I had much difficulty with the background images, as I couldn't find a way to made them whole appear - it was showing only the image part that comprehended the text of that container.
I had to use a numbered height so the project got similar to the design I had.

Then I continued to work on some `div`, mostly with text or pure image.

And then I got to the most difficult part as for now: to align the text of the container to the bottom of it so the background image is showing more it's top. I haven't been able to solve this problem now (the only solution I found was putting a bunch of `<br>` before the `h1` of this specific `div`, and I really don't wanna do that!).
