## Hi! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Luiza Moretti and I am starting on the world of Front-end!

Thanks for checking out this coding challenge. I've got it from Frontend Mentor website, so you should check it out too.

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

## The challenge

The challenge is to build out a given agency landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.
The design can be seen on the top of this page :P

## Where to find everything

All design and assets used are inside the `/design` and the `/image` folder, both mobile and desktop versions.

- The `style-guide.md` file contains the information needed to complete the project, such as color palette and fonts.

## My timeline

<ins>**04/12/2024**

Today I started the challenge, create the repository and organized the files. I also made a pre-project by hand where I decide what to do with every part of the project. I answer questions such as:

- Are there any colors/fonts/design that repeat itself through out the page?
- Are there any element that change color/side when comparing mobile and desktop versions?
    - If yes, which ones?
    - How I pretend to organize the css file to make those changes smoothly and without repeating my code time and time again?

Those answers help me find better ways to think my code and my project, and to organize my work on what should I do now and when do the other things.
